# aim, to find  the top stat ration based on the primary type and size of pokemon (who are the best pokemon to fight)
   ##1, select 3 var
   ##2, group_by `Primary Type` and 'size'
   ##3, count the average state ratio (meanRatio)
   ##4, order  from top to bottom meanRatio and list n=10 top fighter.

pokemonData%>% select(`Primary Type`,size, 'Stat Ratio') %>% group_by(`Primary Type`,'size') %>%  
  summarise(meanRatio =mean ('Stat Ratio',na.rm=T)) %>% arrange(desc(meanRatio), n=10)
